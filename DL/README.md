# Deep Learning
This is a list of my projects on Artificial Neural Networks.

## Implemeting neural networks from scratch

- A simple single-layer [Perceptron](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/DL/perceptron/perceptron.ipynb) for classification with custom data.
- A single-layer feed-forward [Neural Network](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/DL/nn/nn.py) with activation function and backpropagation implemented in Python.

## Keras and Tensorflow

- A [multilayer preceptron](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/DL/mnist) for MNIST dataset classification
with Keras and Tensorflow. 
- A CNN for [traffic signs](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/DL/traffic/trafficSigns.ipynb) recognition with Keras.
