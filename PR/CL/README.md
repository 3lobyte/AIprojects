This is a list of my projects on Computational Language.

## Word detection

[wd.py](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/PR/CL/wd.py) is a Python script that is able to identify words in a chain.
The language is Spanish.
It prints a list with category frequency, word frequency and the corresponding
category frequency, bigram frequency and finally the lexicon and emission
probabilities of a word.
