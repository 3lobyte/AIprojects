# Computational Graphics
This is a list of my projects on Computational Graphics.

## WebGL basics

[dots&lines.html](https://juansensio.github.io/AIprojects/DI/CG/dots&lines.html) is a WebGL example where the user can click inside the canvas and
points appear. Their color fades with respect to the center of the canvas
and lines connect them. 

[robot.html](https://juansensio.github.io/AIprojects/DI/CG/robot.html) is a Three.js example of a robot arm with basic
materials, textures, lightning and interaction.

**Note**: Libraries, images and auxiliar files are located in the gh-pages branch.
