# AI Projects

This is a list of my projects on Artificial Intelligence.


## Applications

- Web [application](https://juansensio.github.io/AIprojects/tfjs/index.html) for real-time image classification using on-device camera with tensorflow.js
- Land Use [APP](https://juansensio.github.io/AIprojects/land-use-app/index.html) for classification of satellite imagery.

## Education

- Learn how to train an object detection model with a dataset from [POINTOUT](https://github.com/juansensio/AIprojects/tree/master/pointout).

## Frameworks

- Some experiments with the [C++ Pytorch API](https://github.com/juansensio/AIprojects/tree/master/pytorch_cpp).
