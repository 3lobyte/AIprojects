# Land Use

This [APP](https://juansensio.github.io/land-use) lets you navigate a map and use a Deep Learning model to classify the type of land.

It was developed for the Meetup "Put your Networks to Work" ([Barcelona School of AI](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Barcelona-School-of-AI/?_locale=es-ES), 2019).
