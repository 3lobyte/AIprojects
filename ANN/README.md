# Artificial Neural Networks
This is a list of my projects on Artificial Neural Networks.

## Perceptron

- My first [Neural Network](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ANN/perceptron/per2d2c.ipynb), a simple single-layer 
Perceptron for 2 classes classification with custom data.
- An update on my first [Neural Network](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ANN/perceptron/per3d2c.ipynb), now with three-dimensional data.
- An update on my first [Neural Network](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ANN/perceptron/per2c.ipynb), now with multi-dimensional data.
