# Fruit Classification with Python

The purpose of this work is to identify the machine learning (ML) algorithm 
that is best-suited for fruit classification. Several ML 
algorithms are implemented in Python using [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
This work is based on [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2)
post by Susan Li. The objective is to get familiar with the Scikit-learn framework
as well as Pandas and the training and test of different ML algorithms.

## Data

The fruits dataset was created by [Dr. Iain Murray](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/) from 
University of Edinburgh. He bought a few dozen oranges, 
lemons and apples of different varieties, and recorded 
their measurements in a table. And then the professors at 
University of Michigan formatted the fruits data slightly 
and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/fruit_data_with_colors.txt).
The data is explored in the following files:

* [data.ipynb](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/data.ipynb) : Data visualization.
* [dataSet.py](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/dataSet.py) : Training and test data sets creation.

## ML Algorithms

Different models:

* [K nearest neighbours](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/KNN.ipynb)
* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/NaiveBayes.ipynb)
* [Linear Discriminant](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/LinearDiscriminant.ipynb)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/LogisticRegression.ipynb)
* [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/JuanSensio/AIprojects/blob/master/ML/fruits/SVM.ipynb)
